# About me
## General Info
My name is Hugir and I am a third year student as UCSD currently taking **CSE 110, 150B, and 105**.
## Programming Journey
I am programmer that is proficient at Java and C++. I also know Python and a little bit of HTML but I hope to get better at those two. The first programming language I learned was Java, everyone who learns Java has engrained into them this line of code ```public static void main(String[] args)```.
## Why I got into CS
I got into CS not for the money but because apart from astronomy, computers had always captivated me as a kid. I vividly remember trying to teach myself Ruby when I was younger but giving up because of a lack of discipline.
## Opinion on AI
As other undergrads I too am worried about the implication of AI in this field. Here is NVIDIA's CEO [opinion](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/24/02/26/1322242/nvidia-ceo-says-kids-shouldnt-learn-to-code?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed) on this matter. I will safely say that most people overestimate future technological advances and that whatver the case my be we do our best to adapt and move on.
